## Schema

### Required

- `apps` (Attributes List) List of apps granted by this access policy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--apps))
- `business_justification` (String) Explanation for why this policy exists.
- `name` (String) The name of the access policy.

### Optional

- `access_condition` (String) The condition determining which identities qualify for this policy. Required if is_everyone_condition is not True. This is a recursive structure that can contain nested conditions using 'and', 'or', and 'not' operators. See the Condition schema for full details. Parsed as JSON.
- `is_everyone_condition` (Boolean) Whether the access policy applies to everyone. If true, access_condition is ignored. Otherwise, access_condition must be provided. Default: false

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique ID of the access policy.

<a id="nestedatt--apps"></a>
### Nested Schema for `apps`

Optional:

- `id` (String) The ID of this app. Not Null
- `is_preapproved` (Boolean) Whether approval is required for this app grant.
- `permissions` (Attributes List) List of permissions granted for this app. Empty list means app-level grant. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--apps--permissions))

<a id="nestedatt--apps--permissions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `apps.permissions`

Optional:

- `id` (String) The ID of this requestable permission.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = lumos_access_policy.my_lumos_access_policy
  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import lumos_access_policy.my_lumos_access_policy "..."
```
